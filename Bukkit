spawn-limits  
Default: monsters:70, animals:10, water-animals:15, ambient:15  
Optimized: monsters:50, animals:8, water-animals:3, ambient:1  
Performance Impact: Medium  

While there is more to this than "mobs per player" (explained in PDF), lower values mean less mobs. Avoid going too low or the mob shortages will be noticeable.  
Subsequent values in the guide will make the reduction less noticeable.   

chunk-gc.period-in-ticks  
Def: 600  
Opt: 400  
Impact: Medium  

âž« This unloads vacant chunks faster. Ticking fewer chunks means less TPS consumption.  

ticks-per.monster-spawns  
Def: 1  
Opt: 4  
Impact: Medium  

This sets how often (in ticks) the server attempts to spawn a monster. Slighty increasing the time between spawns should not impact spawn rates.   

Note: Only go higher if you have significant tick loss to the mobSpawn task.  

autosave  
Def: 6000 (usually)  
Opt: 6000  
Impact: N/A  

This enables Bukkit's world saving and how often it runs (in ticks). It should be 6000 by default, just double check it is not 0 (disabled).  
This is a gradual/queued task (no lag?).  

Note: If you use Multicraft or a plugin to run saves, STOP! They just run the very inefficient /save-all command.  

Worldsave Lag: If you have lag spikes from Worldsave, you might consider Paper's lag-free saving.
