# Server Hardware and Optimization

## Server Requirements
4GB+ Ram  
DDoS Protection  
Automatic Backups  
Fast Internet Connection  

Having many people connecting to your server from around the world
you want to provide the best experience for the players. Hosting a
server from your own network will use a lot of resources on the computer
it is hosted on. To allow people to connect to a server hosted on your
own computer you will have to portfoward and give your ip out to those
who want to connect to the server. By doing this you can be under the 
threat of a DDoS Attack (Denial of Service). I would recommend personally to
pay for hosting which removes a lot of the risk of a DDoS attack.

## Pregenerate World
This is extremely important! It will greatly cut down on lag that can be
created by loading a lot of chunks!

World Pregeneration speed will depend on how fast the cpu your server has!
